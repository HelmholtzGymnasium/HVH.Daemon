## HVH.Service
This is a semi-professional project, maintained by the (student-)administrators of the Hermann-von-Helmholtz Gymnasium in Potsdam, Germany. It aims to provides an easy and stable solution for remote-controlling remote computers in an enterprise network. (like a big company, or a school). It is divided into multiple parts. 

HVH.Service provides the execution components of the system. It works by connecting to a central server who is sending commands to the client node. The client node then performs the neccessarry actions, like locking the computer or shutting it down.

### Configuration
The app reads its settings from an ini file, called settings.ini. This is an example config:
```
[connection]
server=192.168.99.1
port=77799

[security]
keySize=1024
encryption=NoneEncryptionProvider
```
The rest is configured dynamically through the server.
